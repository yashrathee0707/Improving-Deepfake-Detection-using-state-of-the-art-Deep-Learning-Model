# Improving-Deepfake-Detection-using-state-of-the-art-Deep-Learning-Model
In the contemporary digital landscape, the proliferation of deepfake videos presents a formidable threat to the integrity of digital media, fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. 



This study proposes a robust deepfake detection system leveraging Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and RNNs, have demonstrated remarkable
prowess across various domains, including image recognition, natural
language processing, and video analysis. By harnessing these
advancements, our proposed approach aims to effectively distinguish
between authentic and synthetic media, utilizing CNNs for feature
extraction and LSTM networks for temporal analysis, thereby
providing a comprehensive framework for detecting deepfake videos.
